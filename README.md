# Arduino-based PS2 -> Macintosh Plus keyboard adapter

This sketch allows to use a PS/2 keyboard with the Macintosh Plus. Mapping between PS/2 keys and Mac keys is stored in the [keymap.ino](mac_plus_ps2/keymap.ino) file. Sketch uses a modified version of the [PS2Keyboard Library](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_PS2Keyboard.html) --- all the logic except `getScanCode()` method have been stripped.

## Connecting to Macintosh Plus

Get a phone cord with RJ10 plug and connect pin as follows:

1. Vcc -> Vin
2. +DATA -> pin D5,
3. +CLK -> pin D6,
4. GND -> GND.

The order of RJ10 pins is the same as in the computer connector:

## Connecting to PS/2 keyboard

For the Mini-DIN 6 plug, pins should be connected as follows:

1. +DATA -> pin D3,
2. (not connected),
3. GND -> GND,
4. Vcc -> +5V,
5. +CLK -> pin D2,
6. (not connected)

Pinout for the female connector from front (copied from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS/2_port)):
